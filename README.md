# Thin2Thick: Thick-slice Simulation in Multi-Slice Helical CT

Thin2Thick is a project that focuses on the simulation of thick-slice images from multi-slice helical computed tomography (CT) scans. This project contains various algorithms and comparison methods for improved thick-slice image simulations.

## Repository Contents

1. `ThickSimulation.py`: 
   This script contains the core simulation algorithms used for thick-slice image simulation in multi-slice helical CT scans.

2. `OurTS_vs_NaiveTS_AAPM.ipynb`:
   This Jupyter notebook is designed to provide a comparative analysis of images generated by different simulation algorithms.

## Future Updates
This repository is a work in progress. We will continue to add more detailed information and instructions for usage and contribution in the near future. Stay tuned!
